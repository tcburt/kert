** TODO Report Types

A report template must accomodate two main capabilities:
 1. Files to copy into project space
 2. Customization from template to project

*** Mechanism ideas

**** Meta Templates
Assume that all files for a new report type are segregated from other types
via a special directory.  Capability 1 is satisfied if all files in that
directory are the source for the new project space.  The possibility for
file list overrides will be addressed after introducing the concept of a
generator configuration.

The second capability, customization, can be more complex than a simple
file rename.
