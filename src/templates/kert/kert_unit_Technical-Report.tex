\section{Overview}
\label{sec:Overview}

This section is intended to provide an overview of the
customer activities which led to this study being performed.  This
should be a ``big picture'' view of how this study relates to the
overall effort being conducted. For example it could describe the
overall effort to define an \gls{RFC} to bring a new capability into
the baseline and provide context for how this study fits into
this effort.

\section{Background}
\label{sec:Background}

This section is intended to provide technically-based
background information on the items under investigation as part of
this study.  This content should be used to educate the reader on the
technology under investigation before we dive into the study details.

\section{Objective}
\label{sec:Objective}

This section should state the objective of the
study written in past tense\footnote{%
  \label{fn:pastTense}%
  The cost of rewriting something that ``should come directly from''
  another source should be weighed against the loss of efficiency and
  consistency. %
} (The objective of this study was \ldots). This should come directly
from the project briefing.

\chapter{Study Methodology}
\label{sec:StudyMethodology}

Explain in detail how the study was accomplished and the
technical approach used.

\section{Raw Data Examination}
\label{sec:RawDataExamination}

Describe what was done to examine the raw data.  This should
include any outlier analysis performed and the results from this
analysis.  This will typically come directly from the statistician
assigned to the study.

% --------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Analysis}
\label{sec:Analysis}

Describe the analysis that was performed on the data and the
corresponding results.  This section should include results in the
form of graphs / tables for all analyses performed as part of the
study.  Each figure should have text supporting it to explain the
result that was obtained.

\chapter{Conclusions}
\label{sec:Conclusions}

This section should wrap-up the analysis and tie it back to the
satisfaction of the study objective.

\chapter{Recommendations}
\label{sec:Recommendations}


This section should provide the specific actionable
recommendations coming out of the study.  This includes follow-up
analysis, implementation suggestions, changes to the baseline for a
program, etc.
